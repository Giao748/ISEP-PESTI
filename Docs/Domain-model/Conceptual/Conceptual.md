##  Planet Pulse Domain Model

Welcome! Below you'll find the **domain model** that the **GILT Association** believes it best illustrates the concept to be present on project Description.

The domain model is a conceptual representation of the business logic and entities involved in the Planet Pulse project. It serves as a foundation for understanding the true concepts and the problem involved

The main concepts here are clearly news, users, and the relationships between them. The model captures the essential attributes and relationships that define the domain.
The model includes entities such as `User`, `News`, `Category`, and `Feedback`, along with their attributes and relationships.
