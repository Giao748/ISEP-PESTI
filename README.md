# Project Description

## **Context**

A website is to be created that provides stories about species and makes them available to users.

The main goal of the website to be developed is to raise awareness about new species or news regarding animals on our planet:

The planet we inhabit is facing unprecedented pressure due to the rapid growth of the economy and population. This challenge requires structured responses that can be promoted through civil society initiatives aimed at fostering environmental sustainability. These initiatives can, in particular, contribute significantly to the adoption of good practices and to the mitigation of environmentally harmful behaviors.

The dissemination of environmental initiatives and the active participation of citizens in identifying and reporting both good and bad environmental practices in their region will contribute to greater awareness, reinforce a sense of responsibility, and promote sustainable attitudes with lasting impact on both current and future generations.

## **Objectives**

Development of a web application to view, submit, search for, and manage news related to environmental sustainability practices and biodiversity, created by international teams of young people. It will include the necessary features to allow user registration, support for browsing and searching, news submission, validation, and automatic publishing.

The aim is to equip young people with tools to collaborate in the creation and publication of content that promotes good environmental initiatives and exposes unsustainable practices.
